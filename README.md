# OneTextHelp

This project was created as part of the ASPIRE Hackathon. Our goal was to create a solution by which a single text from a person in need can reach out to millions of helping hands. So we created an SMS based architecture for connecting people with NO internet to the internet.

## What is OneTextHelp?

- With the occurrence of the war , the number of war victims trying to reach out for help has drastically increased. This has led to an exponential increase in the number of calls that the NGOs and various helpline numbers received. 
- Many probing questions led to the development of OneTextHelp. OneTextHelp lets the victim send an SOS message on the helpline number provided by us. This message will be broadcasted on social media for better reach and quicker response. This improves the chances of receiving aid.
- The sole purpose of this solution is to serve humanity. Hence, the sustenance of the application can depend on crowdfunding.

## Why is it needed?

- The novelty of the idea, to connect to the internet WITHOUT internet , contributes as a major reason to propose the solution.
- This solution has also paved the way to smoothen the process of connecting a volunteer to the victim at a much higher rate.
- With the increase in instability , from wars to natural disasters, the solution is a necessity for those in dire need of help. 
- Unlike earlier times, social media has a much more presence in everyoneâ€™s life and has proven to be a huge contributor in connecting the necessary aid.
